# Brew Crew APP
A simple app that uses firebase as a backend which helps small group of people say a certain department in a company seamlessly define the type of coffee they want...

USE CASE: Imagine there is a unit in a company e.g Software dev that likes to take coffee in the morning or anytime during the day, instead of causing confusion in what kind of coffee each person would love to have, they could signup on the app, customize thier name and define stenght and number of sugars they want in thier coffee and then the errand person or whoever knows exactly what to do
